Hugh:Blackmail letters… This is unexpected. I never imagined Isabella had this kind of life behind her facade.
(Hugh scans the letters, piecing together the implications of what he’s discovered.)
Hugh: It looks like she knew how to play her cards, even at others' expense. This wasn’t just a simple case of murder; she was tangled in something much darker.
(He pauses, a mix of intrigue and concern brewing within him.)
Hugh: I thought this was just a simple murder case, but these letters tell a different story. She wasn’t just caught in the crossfire - she was actively involved in a web of deceit.
Hugh: Who else was she blackmailing? How many lives did she touch, and how deeply? This opens up a whole new angle to the case.
Hugh: There’s more to this story, and I’m going to uncover it, no matter where it leads.
