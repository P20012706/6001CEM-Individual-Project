Hugh: Anything else you can tell me about her?
Forensic: Well, the clothes are high-end. Tailored. Whoever she was, she had money or someone who spent a lot on her.
Hugh: So what’s someone like that doing here, in Crime Alley?
Forensic: Good question. This isn’t exactly the kind of place you go for fine dining. More likely, she was meeting someone. Could’ve been business, could’ve been personal. Hard to say without digging into her background.
Hugh: Anything stand out about the scene?
Forensic: The way the body’s positioned—it wasn’t random. Whoever killed her didn’t just leave her; they arranged her. Like they wanted her to be found this way. That’s deliberate.
Hugh: You see that a lot?
Forensic: More often than I’d like. Greyborough’s not just a city of crime—it’s a city of messages. This could be one of them. Whether it’s personal or professional… that’s for you to figure out.
Hugh: And what do you think?
Forensic: I think whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing. This wasn’t their first time.
