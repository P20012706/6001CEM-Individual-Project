Hugh: Alright, let’s see if the Operator can dig up something useful.
Operator: Detective Hugh? What do you need?
Hugh: I found an ID card that probably belongs to the victim. Isabella Carrington. Could you look it up for her address for me?
Operator: Sure thing, be right back with you. 
Operator: Good job, Detective. The victim’s name matches our records. Isabella Carrington — she lived in on Sunset Drive. I’ll send you the address now. Check your notebook for the location.
