description = "Ariel Jones, the victimâ€™s neighbour, claims to have heard and seen nothing unusual on the night of the murder. Living in a quiet, upscale area, they assume the broken window was just an isolated act of vandalism. Yet, their aloof attitude seems strangely dismissive for someone living so close to a crime scene."
