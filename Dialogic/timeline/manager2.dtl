Hugh: Rough night for Nathan, huh?
Manager: Every night’s rough for him. He’s been spiralling for years—Greyborough has that effect on people.
Hugh: What do you mean?
Manager: Take a look around. Dead Man’s Gambit isn’t just a name; it’s a lifestyle. People gamble away their futures hoping for one big break. Nathan was no different—a hotshot businessman reduced to chasing luck.
Hugh: And the city?
Manager: Greyborough thrives on desperation. Everyone’s running from something or chasing something they’ll never catch. A few get lucky, most don’t.
Manager: You are new here, aren't you? Friendly advice, pack up and leave while you can.
Hugh: Um... Thanks? But I'm here to stay
Manager: Well, I did warn you. Good luck with your investigation.
