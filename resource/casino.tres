description = "In this town, they call it ‘Dead Man’s Gambit’ for a reason. The house always wins—until it doesn’t. For those who take a seat at the tables, it’s a game of chance with more than money at stake. Old debts, desperate decisions, and a bad hand can lead to more than just a loss. If you’re looking for trouble, you’ll find it here, but tread carefully; you might not make it out with your life."
