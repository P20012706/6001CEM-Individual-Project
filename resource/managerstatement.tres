description = "The casino manager confirms that Nathan was at the casino last night, arriving as usual but leaving before midnight—no surprise given his quick losses. However, his departure was unusual; just before he left, someone mocked him at the table, taunting him about his failures and his wife’s infidelity.
Furious, Nathan stormed out, ready to snap. The manager notes that this inappropriate behavior, along with hitting his debt limit, led to his removal from the casino."
