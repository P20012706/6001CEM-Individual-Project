Hugh: Patrolman Henry, right? I’m Detective Galloway.  

Patrolman: That’s me. Welcome to Greyborough, Detective. First case here, huh? Crime Alley sure doesn’t give you an easy start.  

Hugh: Seems like it. What can you tell me about the scene?  

Patrolman: Not much yet. Forensics is doing their thing. I got here right after the call came in—someone reported a dead body.  

Hugh: And the hobo?  

Patrolman: Oh, him? That’s Old Billy. Been around these parts for years. He’s harmless enough, but… well, let’s just say he sees a lot from his little corner. Whether he admits it or not, he knows more than he lets on.  

Hugh: Why’s that?  

Patrolman: Greyborough’s got its fair share of drifters, but Billy’s different. He’s sharp, even if he doesn’t look it. Doesn’t trust cops much, though—can’t say I blame him.  

Hugh: Why’s that?  

Patrolman: Some bad run-ins in the past. Got picked up a few times for petty theft, but nothing ever stuck. I reckon he’s just trying to survive, like the rest of the folks around here.  

Hugh: Think he’ll talk?  

Patrolman: If you’re patient—and maybe give him a reason to. He’s not as disconnected as he acts. Something about this place keeps him here. Makes you wonder.  

Hugh: Thanks for the heads-up. Anything else I should know?  

Patrolman: (pausing, looking at the scene) Just… keep an eye out. This city’s got a way of hiding things in plain sight.  

Hugh: I’ll keep that in mind.
