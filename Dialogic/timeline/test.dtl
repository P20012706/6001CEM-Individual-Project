Roy: Alright, remember to check your surroundings. Observation is the key to securing every evidence on scene.
Hugh: Well, it looks just like any dead body. Care to fill me in? You're the forensic guy after all.
Forensic: No knife wounds, no strangle marks so the murder weapon might be something blunt and strong.
Forensic: There's sign of jewellery being forcefully if you look at the victim's right hand. Probably  a wedding ring.
Hugh: Time of death?
Forensic: From the wounds, I would assume around 2\:00 am but I need to get back to the lab for the real results.
